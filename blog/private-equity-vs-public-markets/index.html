                    <p>By <strong>Jack Estes DeBrabander</strong> | Published January 25, 2026</p>
                </div>

                <p>The decision of where to allocate investment capital is one of the most consequential choices an investor can make. For decades, public stock markets have been the default destination for most investors, offering liquidity, transparency, and the convenience of regulated exchanges. However, a growing number of sophisticated investors are recognizing that the private markets offer a fundamentally different set of opportunities and advantages that can significantly enhance overall portfolio performance. Jack Estes DeBrabander specializes in helping accredited investors understand these differences and make informed decisions about incorporating private market investments into their broader financial strategies.</p>

                <p>This article provides a thorough comparison of private equity and public market investing, examining the key dimensions of liquidity, return potential, risk profiles, transparency, and portfolio construction. By understanding the trade-offs and complementary nature of these two investment arenas, investors can develop a more nuanced approach to building wealth. Jack Estes DeBrabander believes that an informed investor is a better investor, and this analysis is designed to provide the clarity needed to evaluate both sides of the equation.</p>

                <h2>Understanding the Fundamental Distinction</h2>

                <p>At the most basic level, the difference between private equity and public markets comes down to access and structure. Public markets consist of regulated exchanges such as the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ, where shares of publicly listed companies are bought and sold by millions of investors every day. These companies have undergone the full SEC registration process, are subject to extensive disclosure requirements, and their share prices are determined in real time by supply and demand dynamics on the exchange.</p>

                <p>Private equity, by contrast, involves investing directly in companies that are not listed on public exchanges. These investments are typically structured as private placement offerings under Regulation D and are available exclusively to accredited investors and qualified institutional buyers. Private companies are not required to make the same level of public disclosure as their publicly traded counterparts, and their shares cannot be freely traded on an exchange. Jack Estes DeBrabander operates within this private market ecosystem, sourcing opportunities in companies that are at various stages of growth and development but share the common characteristic of not yet being accessible through public channels.</p>

                <p>This fundamental distinction creates a cascade of differences in how these two types of investments behave, the returns they generate, the risks they carry, and the role they play within a diversified portfolio. Understanding these differences is essential for any investor considering an allocation to private markets.</p>

                <h2>Liquidity: The Core Trade-Off</h2>

                <p>The most significant difference between private equity and public market investments is liquidity. Public market securities can typically be bought or sold within seconds during trading hours, with prices that reflect real-time market sentiment. This immediate liquidity is one of the most valued features of public market investing, as it allows investors to adjust their positions quickly in response to changing market conditions or personal financial needs.</p>

                <p>Private equity investments, by their nature, are illiquid. When an investor commits capital to a private placement, that capital is generally locked up for an extended period, often ranging from three to ten years depending on the nature of the investment and the company's timeline for a liquidity event. Liquidity events in private markets typically take the form of an Initial Public Offering, an acquisition by another company, or a secondary market transaction where existing shares are sold to another private buyer.</p>

                <p>Jack Estes DeBrabander is transparent with investors about this trade-off because it is fundamental to the private market value proposition. The illiquidity of private investments is not merely a drawback; it is a structural feature that generates what is known as the "illiquidity premium." Because investors are compensated for accepting reduced liquidity, private market returns have historically exceeded public market returns over comparable time periods. This premium is a central reason why institutional investors such as endowments, pension funds, and sovereign wealth funds allocate significant portions of their portfolios to private markets.</p>

                <h2>Return Potential: Historical Performance Compared</h2>

                <p>One of the most compelling arguments for private market investing is the return potential. Historical data consistently shows that private equity has outperformed public markets over long time horizons. According to research from Cambridge Associates and other industry benchmarks, top-quartile private equity funds have generated net internal rates of return that substantially exceed the returns of major public market indices such as the S&P 500.</p>

                <p>Several factors contribute to this outperformance. First, private equity investors gain access to companies during their highest growth phases, before public market pricing absorbs much of the upside. A company that grows revenue from $50 million to $500 million while private generates the vast majority of its return for private investors who entered at the earlier stage. By the time the company goes public, much of that growth trajectory is already priced into the IPO valuation.</p>

                <p>Second, private equity investments benefit from active management and operational improvements that are not available in passive public market investing. Private equity firms and sponsors often work closely with company management to implement strategic initiatives, improve operational efficiency, and drive growth. Jack Estes DeBrabander evaluates the quality of management teams and the potential for operational value creation as a core component of the due diligence process, ensuring that the companies presented to investors have both the market opportunity and the operational capacity to deliver strong returns.</p>

                <h2>Risk Profiles: A Different Kind of Risk</h2>

                <p>Risk in public markets is dominated by market risk, or the risk that broader market movements will affect the value of an investment regardless of the underlying company's performance. Public stock prices are subject to daily fluctuations driven by macroeconomic events, interest rate changes, geopolitical developments, and investor sentiment. Even well-managed companies with strong fundamentals can see their stock prices decline significantly during periods of market stress.</p>

                <p>Private equity carries a different set of risks. Because private companies are not traded on exchanges, their valuations are not subject to the same daily volatility. This reduces the emotional impact of short-term market movements and allows investors to focus on the long-term fundamental performance of the business. However, private equity carries meaningful risks of its own, including the risk of total loss of principal, concentration risk if an investor has a large allocation to a small number of deals, and the execution risk associated with early-stage or growth-stage companies that may not achieve their business plans.</p>

                <p>Jack Estes DeBrabander takes a rigorous approach to risk management in private market investing. This includes comprehensive due diligence on every opportunity, diversification across sectors and stages, and careful attention to deal structure and investor protections. While no investment is without risk, Jack Estes DeBrabander believes that disciplined selection and thorough analysis can significantly improve the risk-adjusted returns available in private markets.</p>

                <h2>Transparency and Information Access</h2>

                <p>Public companies are subject to extensive disclosure requirements imposed by the SEC. They must file quarterly and annual financial reports, disclose material events, and provide shareholders with detailed information about executive compensation, corporate governance, and related-party transactions. This level of transparency is a significant advantage for public market investors, as it allows them to make informed decisions based on a comprehensive and standardized set of financial data.</p>

                <p>Private companies, operating under Regulation D exemptions, are not subject to the same level of mandatory disclosure. While private placement memoranda and offering documents provide important information about the company and the terms of the investment, the ongoing reporting obligations are generally determined by the terms of the offering agreement rather than by regulatory mandate. This means that the quality and frequency of information available to private market investors can vary significantly from one deal to another.</p>

                <p>Jack Estes DeBrabander addresses this information gap by conducting independent due diligence that goes beyond the materials provided by issuers and by negotiating information rights on behalf of investors wherever possible. This includes regular financial reporting, company update calls, and access to key performance metrics. The goal is to ensure that investors in private placements sourced through Jack Estes DeBrabander receive a level of transparency that approaches what they would expect from a public market investment, even though the regulatory requirements differ.</p>

                <h2>Portfolio Construction: The Case for Allocation</h2>

                <p>Modern portfolio theory emphasizes the importance of diversification across asset classes with different return drivers and correlation profiles. Private equity fulfills this mandate effectively because its returns are driven by factors that are fundamentally different from those driving public market returns. While public market returns are heavily influenced by interest rates, macroeconomic cycles, and investor sentiment, private equity returns are driven primarily by company-level operational performance, strategic execution, and the timing and nature of exit events.</p>

                <p>Leading institutional investors have recognized this for decades. Endowments such as those at Yale and Harvard have famously allocated 30 percent or more of their portfolios to private equity and other alternative investments, and these allocations have been a significant contributor to their long-term outperformance relative to more traditionally allocated portfolios. While individual accredited investors may not allocate as aggressively as large endowments, even a modest allocation to private markets can meaningfully improve risk-adjusted portfolio returns.</p>

                <p>Jack Estes DeBrabander works with each investor to determine an appropriate private market allocation based on their specific financial situation, investment objectives, and liquidity needs. There is no one-size-fits-all answer, and the right allocation depends on factors including the investor's time horizon, existing portfolio composition, income stability, and overall risk tolerance. The key insight that Jack Estes DeBrabander emphasizes is that private and public market investments are not mutually exclusive; they are complementary components of a well-constructed portfolio.</p>

                <h2>Why Jack Estes DeBrabander Focuses on Private Markets</h2>

                <p>The decision to specialize in private market investments reflects a deep conviction that this is where the greatest opportunities exist for accredited investors seeking superior returns. Public markets are efficient, well-researched, and accessible to everyone with a brokerage account. The very efficiency of public markets means that it is extraordinarily difficult for any individual investor to generate consistent excess returns through public stock selection alone.</p>

                <p>Private markets, by contrast, remain inefficient in ways that create genuine opportunities for informed investors. Information asymmetry, limited access to deal flow, the complexity of private company evaluation, and the illiquidity premium all contribute to an environment where disciplined investors can generate returns that are simply not available in public markets. Jack Estes DeBrabander has built the expertise, network, and analytical framework needed to identify and capture these opportunities on behalf of accredited investors.</p>

                <p>The private market is not without its challenges, and Jack Estes DeBrabander is forthright about the trade-offs involved. Reduced liquidity, longer time horizons, and the need for thorough due diligence all require a different mindset from public market investing. But for investors who are willing to accept these characteristics in exchange for the potential for materially higher returns and genuine portfolio diversification, private market investing offers a compelling value proposition that Jack Estes DeBrabander is uniquely positioned to deliver.</p>
