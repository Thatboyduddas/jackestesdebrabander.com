                    <p>By <strong>Jack Estes DeBrabander</strong> | Published January 20, 2026</p>
                </div>

                <p>Regulation D is the cornerstone of private capital formation in the United States. It is the SEC regulatory framework that enables companies to raise capital through private placements without undergoing the costly, time-consuming process of full public registration. For accredited investors, understanding Regulation D is essential because it defines the rules under which the private placement offerings they participate in are structured, marketed, and executed. Jack Estes DeBrabander works extensively within the Regulation D framework to source and structure private placement offerings that provide accredited investors with access to high-growth companies while maintaining full regulatory compliance.</p>

                <p>In this article, Jack Estes DeBrabander provides a detailed breakdown of Regulation D, its key exemptions, the differences between Rule 506(b) and Rule 506(c), and the practical implications for both issuers and investors. This knowledge is foundational for anyone seeking to participate in private market investing, and understanding these regulatory mechanics can help investors make more informed decisions about the opportunities they choose to pursue.</p>

                <h2>What Is Regulation D?</h2>

                <p>Regulation D is a set of rules promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Act of 1933. The Securities Act generally requires that any offer or sale of securities be registered with the SEC unless an exemption from registration applies. Registration is an expensive and time-intensive process that involves extensive disclosure requirements, financial auditing, and ongoing reporting obligations. For many companies, particularly those in early or growth stages, the cost and complexity of a full public registration are prohibitive.</p>

                <p>Regulation D provides a series of exemptions that allow companies to offer and sell securities to investors without going through the full registration process. These exemptions are not automatic; companies must comply with specific conditions related to the type of investors who can participate, the amount of capital that can be raised, and how the offering is marketed. When these conditions are met, the offering is considered a "private placement" and is exempt from SEC registration requirements.</p>

                <p>Jack Estes DeBrabander emphasizes that Regulation D exemptions do not exempt companies from the antifraud provisions of federal securities laws. Even in a private placement, issuers are required to provide accurate, non-misleading information to investors. This is why thorough due diligence remains essential, and it is a core part of the value that Jack Estes DeBrabander delivers to every investor in the network.</p>

                <h2>Rule 504: Smaller Offerings</h2>

                <p>Rule 504 of Regulation D provides an exemption for offerings of up to $10 million within a twelve-month period. This rule is typically used by smaller companies that are raising relatively modest amounts of capital. Under Rule 504, the securities sold may be restricted, meaning they cannot be freely resold by investors without registration or another applicable exemption, unless the offering meets certain state-level requirements that permit general solicitation and non-restricted securities.</p>

                <p>While Rule 504 offerings are less common in the institutional-quality private placement market, they serve an important role in the broader capital formation ecosystem by enabling early-stage companies to access seed and early-round funding. Jack Estes DeBrabander primarily focuses on larger-scale offerings under Rules 506(b) and 506(c), which are better suited to the investment profiles and return expectations of the accredited investors in the network. However, understanding Rule 504 provides useful context for the full spectrum of Regulation D activity.</p>

                <h2>Rule 506(b): The Traditional Private Placement</h2>

                <p>Rule 506(b) is the most widely used exemption under Regulation D and has been the backbone of private capital formation for decades. Under this rule, a company can raise an unlimited amount of capital from an unlimited number of accredited investors, plus up to 35 non-accredited investors who are "sophisticated" enough to evaluate the merits and risks of the investment. The defining restriction of Rule 506(b) is that the issuer cannot engage in general solicitation or general advertising to market the offering.</p>

                <p>This prohibition on general solicitation means that 506(b) offerings can only be presented to investors with whom the issuer, or its authorized intermediary, has a pre-existing substantive relationship. The offering cannot be advertised in newspapers, on websites, through social media, or via any other broadly disseminated communication channel. This restriction is precisely what makes access to deal flow so valuable in the private placement market, and it is a primary reason why investors work with specialists like Jack Estes DeBrabander who maintain extensive networks of company relationships.</p>

                <p>One of the advantages of Rule 506(b) for issuers is that it does not require formal verification of accredited investor status. Investors can self-certify their accreditation through a questionnaire or representation letter. While this simplifies the investment process, Jack Estes DeBrabander counsels investors to ensure they genuinely meet the accredited investor criteria before making any representations, as material misrepresentation can have legal consequences.</p>

                <p>Rule 506(b) offerings also preempt state securities registration requirements, meaning the issuer does not need to register the offering in each state where investors reside. The issuer must, however, file a Form D with the SEC within 15 days of the first sale of securities, and many states require a notice filing as well. Jack Estes DeBrabander ensures that all offerings presented to investors have completed the necessary regulatory filings and are in full compliance with both federal and state requirements.</p>

                <h2>Rule 506(c): The Modern Alternative</h2>

                <p>Rule 506(c) was introduced in 2013 as part of the implementation of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act. It represented a significant departure from traditional private placement practice by permitting issuers to use general solicitation and advertising to market their offerings. This means that 506(c) offerings can be promoted through websites, social media, email campaigns, conferences, and other public channels that are off-limits under 506(b).</p>

                <p>The trade-off for this expanded marketing ability is a stricter investor qualification requirement: under Rule 506(c), all purchasers must be verified accredited investors. Unlike the self-certification permitted under 506(b), issuers conducting a 506(c) offering must take "reasonable steps" to verify that each investor meets the accredited investor criteria. The SEC has outlined several safe harbor verification methods, including reviewing tax returns and W-2 forms for income verification, reviewing bank and brokerage statements along with credit reports for net worth verification, and obtaining written confirmation from a qualified third party such as a registered broker-dealer, SEC-registered investment adviser, licensed attorney, or CPA.</p>

                <p>Jack Estes DeBrabander works with both 506(b) and 506(c) offerings, and the choice of exemption depends on the specific circumstances of each deal. For companies with a strong existing investor network, 506(b) may be preferable due to its simpler verification requirements. For companies that need to reach a broader audience of potential investors, 506(c) offers the advantage of general solicitation while maintaining the unlimited capital raise and state preemption benefits of Rule 506. Jack Estes DeBrabander helps investors understand which type of offering they are participating in and ensures that all verification requirements are handled efficiently and correctly.</p>

                <h2>How Companies Raise Capital Through Regulation D</h2>

                <p>The process of raising capital through a Regulation D offering involves several key steps, each of which requires careful planning and execution. First, the company and its legal counsel determine which exemption is most appropriate for the offering based on the amount of capital needed, the target investor profile, and the desired marketing approach. This strategic decision shapes the entire structure of the placement.</p>

                <p>Next, the company prepares the offering documents, which typically include a Private Placement Memorandum (PPM), subscription agreement, and operating or shareholder agreements. The PPM is the most critical document, as it provides investors with detailed information about the company, its business plan, the terms of the offering, the use of proceeds, and a comprehensive discussion of risk factors. Jack Estes DeBrabander reviews these documents carefully as part of the due diligence process, ensuring that they are thorough, accurate, and provide investors with the information they need to make informed decisions.</p>

                <p>Once the offering documents are prepared, the company begins marketing the placement to potential investors, either through private channels under 506(b) or through broader marketing efforts under 506(c). Investors who express interest review the offering materials, conduct their own due diligence, and, if they choose to proceed, complete the subscription process. After closing, the company files Form D with the SEC and any required state notice filings.</p>

                <h2>How Jack Estes DeBrabander Structures Offerings Under Regulation D</h2>

                <p>Jack Estes DeBrabander brings a disciplined, investor-focused approach to every Regulation D offering in the portfolio. The process begins with rigorous deal sourcing, where Jack Estes DeBrabander identifies companies that are seeking to raise capital through private placements and evaluates whether they meet the quality standards required for presentation to the investor network.</p>

                <p>Once a potential offering is identified, Jack Estes DeBrabander conducts comprehensive due diligence that goes beyond simply reviewing the offering documents. This includes independent financial analysis, management team evaluation, market research, competitive assessment, and legal and structural review. Only offerings that pass this multi-layered evaluation process are presented to investors.</p>

                <p>Jack Estes DeBrabander also works closely with issuers to ensure that the terms of each offering are fair and reasonable for investors. This includes negotiating valuation terms, liquidation preferences, anti-dilution provisions, and information rights that protect investor interests. The goal is to ensure that every Regulation D offering in the portfolio represents a genuine opportunity for investors to achieve meaningful returns while managing risk through sound structural protections.</p>

                <p>For investors, the result is a streamlined experience where the complexity of Regulation D compliance is handled behind the scenes, allowing them to focus on evaluating the merits of each opportunity and making informed investment decisions. Jack Estes DeBrabander believes that this combination of regulatory expertise, rigorous due diligence, and investor-first deal structuring is what sets the firm apart in the private placement market.</p>
